<!--:en--><p>Yes, we skipped versions 2.0 and never released it in public, but it was worth it.</p>
<p>Subsurface 2.1 is out, we have binaries for Windows and Mac on our <a href="https://subsurface-divelog.org/downloads/">Downloads</a> page and packages for various Linux distributions are under way. And of course it's quite easy to build Subsurface from source - check the <a href="https://subsurface-divelog.org/documentation/building/">build page</a> for details.</p>
<p><a href="https://subsurface-divelog.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screenshot-Subsurface-2.1.png"><img src="https://subsurface-divelog.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screenshot-Subsurface-2.1.png" alt="Screenshot-Subsurface-2.1" title="Screenshot-Subsurface-2.1" width="983" height="719" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-214" /></a></p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights of what changed since Subsurface 1.2:<ul>
<li>Localization into more than ten languages</li>
<li>Dives can be grouped by dive trips (both automatically and manually)</li>
<li>Tracking of weight systems, exposure suit</li>
<li>Improved import from other divelog programs</li>
<li>Improved editing of existing dives</li>
<li>Improved statistics functionality</li>
<li>Better file handling, introduction of a default file (useful for starting Subsurface from the desktop)</li>
<li>Significantly improved Windows and Mac binary packages</li>
<li>Improved handling of shorter apnea dives</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes, stability improvements</li>
<li>Beginnings of <a href="https://subsurface-divelog.org/documentation/user-manual/">end user documentation</a> (needs to be extended a lot, I think, but it's a great start)</li>
<li>Update to libdivecomputer 0.2 with a long list of <a href="http://www.divesoftware.org/libdc/">supported dive computers</a></li>
<li>Direct download from Uemis dive computers</li>
</ul></p><!--:-->
