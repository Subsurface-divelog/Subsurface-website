We had public access to beta releases of <em>Subsurface-mobile</em> for Android for a while: simply <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.subsurfacedivelog.mobile">opt in for the Android beta channel</a>.

As of this week, Apple has a similar feature with TestFlight. So now you can <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/k2OGhIS5">opt in for the iOS beta channel</a> as well.

Advantages:
<ul>
	<li>much more frequent releases</li>
	<li>earlier access to new features</li>
	<li>earlier access to support for more dive computers</li>
</ul>

Downsides:
<ul>
	<li>much more frequent releases</li>
	<li>at times things break</li>
</ul>

You can always go back to the release versions (both vendors make this a tiny bit painful, but it's possible) and typically we try to be good about fixing bugs quickly. So far we have not seen situations where an actual data loss happened - so even when things get broken, you shouldn't have to fear about your dive list.
