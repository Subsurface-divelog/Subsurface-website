<!--:en--><p>We're getting closer to the next release and quite a few new features have been added.</p>
<p>The default view now groups dives by (what it thinks are your) dive trips.</p>
<p>Subsurface now allows you to track your exposure protection.</p>
<p>The handling of weight systems has been significantly improved.</p>
<p>You can now edit multiple dives at once (very useful after importing the dives from a day or even a whole dive trip - just set the location, suit, dive buddy, cylinder and weight system used for all of the dives).</p>
<p>Please try things out and let us know how these things are working for you. Right now no new binaries are available, so please <a href="https://subsurface-divelog.org/documentation/building/">build</a> from the sources in the <a href="http://git.subsurface-divelog.org/index.cgi?p=subsurface.git;a=summary">git repository</a>.</p> <!--:-->
