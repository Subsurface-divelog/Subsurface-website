The Subsurface development team proudly announces the release 4.7.4 of Subsurface, an open source dive log and dive planning program for Windows, Mac and Linux.

For those playing along, yes, because of a small maintainer-error we went from 4.7.2 straight to 4.7.4. The only difference from 4.7.3 to 4.7.4 is that 4.7.3 forgot to update to the latest translations.

The big news for Linux users is that with Subsurface 4.7.4 the AppImage is back. Not only that, we now offer an automatically created AppImage for our ongoing development work directly from our GitHub releases page.

Some of the other changes since Subsurface 4.7.2:

<ul>
	<li>SmallUI fixes</li>
	<li>Improvement to oxygen breaks code in planner</li>
	<li>Write log messages into files when not started from a console on Windows</li>
	<li>Improved detection of OpenGL versions (prevents potential crash on more operating systems with ancient gfx drivers)</li>
	<li>Improve the map widget editing behavior. Allow updating the location of a marker that is being edited by entering new coordinates in the text field in "real-time". Also, don't place new markers at the 0,0 coordinate and instead place them at the current map center.</li>
</ul>
