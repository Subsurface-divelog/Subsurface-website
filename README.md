# Subsurface-website
Wordpress to GitHub integration of the full Subsurface website, including all translations

.de: Deutch
.en: English
.es: Español
.fr: Français
.it: Italiano
.pl: Polski
.pt-pt: Português

This is still very fragile and doesn't always sync correctly.
Especially if a user is logged into the website in a language other than English, 
things seem to be going wrong when changes are pushed from Wordpress to Github.
